##Pseudocode and Assumptions for HW2

1. 
Pseudocode:

-Save the input filename, output filename, and desired number of iterations from command line
-Open the correct input file and output file
-For each line in the file
	-add it to an array
-Delete the first item in the array which is the header of the sequnce file
-For each line in the array
	-Delete \n at end of string
	-Normalize string to lowercase
-For each iteration
	-Set seed string to empty string and two score counters to 0
	-Get to random indices for array of sequences
	-check to make sure indices aren't the same
	-For each possible 8mer in first selected string
		-Set current focus 8mer in first string to varible
		-For each possible 8mer in second selected string
			-Set current focus 8mer in second string to variable
			-Score similarity of 2 8mers
			-if (that score is greater than seed score)
				-set new best seed score
				-set new best 8mers to variables
	-Set seed string to median of two best 8mers from selected string
	-Set motif score to 0
	-For each sequence in array:
		-Set current string's max to 0
		-For each possible 8mer in current sequence
			-Score similarity between 8mer and seed string
			-If (that score is greater than the string's current max score)
				-set string's current max score to that score
		-Add current string's max score to current motif's max score
	-If(current motif's max score is greater than the best motif's max score)
		-set global best motif score to current motif's score
		-set global best motif to current motif
	-Output results from this iteration to file
-Output to file the best motif for the set of sequences
-close i/o
